# ConstrainedBox Demo: With vs. Without Constraints

This Flutter demo shows how `ConstrainedBox` can **limit the growth** of a widget even when the child widget is trying to grow beyond the limit. This version compares it side-by-side with an unconstrained widget so the difference is visually striking.

## Widget Summary

`ConstrainedBox` imposes **minimum and maximum size constraints** on its child. This is useful for layout control, especially when you want to avoid unbounded widget growth.

## How to Run

1. git clone the repository
2. cd constrainedbox-demo
3 .Run the Flutter app on emulator,phone or browser
